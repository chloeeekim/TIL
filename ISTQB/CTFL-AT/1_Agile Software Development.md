### 1.1.1 Agile Software Development and the Agile Manifesto

Agile Manifesto contains four statements of values:  
- Individuals and interactions *over* processes and tools
- Working software *over* comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration *over* contract negotiation
- Responding to change *over* following a plan

#### Individuals and Interactions

Agile development: very **people-centered**  
Continuous communication and interaction > Reliance on tools and processes

#### Working Software

Working software > Detailed documentation  
Provides opportunities to get customer's rapid feedback  
Provides **time-to-market advantage**: available early development lifecycle  
Agile development is useful:  
- Rapidly changing business environments
- Problems/solutions are unclear
- Wishes to innovate in new domain

#### Customer Collaboration

Difficult to specify customer's requirements  
Collaborating improves understanding what customer requires  
Regular and close collaboration > Having contracts

#### Responding to Change

Change is **inevitable**  
Lots of factors can have major influences on project and its objectives  
Factors must be accommodated by the development process  
Having Flexibility > Adhering rigidly to a plan

#### Principles

Core Agile Manifesto values are captured in 12 principles:  
- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage
- Deliver working software frequently, at intervals of between a few weeks to a few months, with a preference to the shorter timescale
- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project
- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done
- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation
- Working software is the primary measure of progress
- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility
- Simplicity-the art of maximizing amount of work not done-is essential
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly


### 1.1.2 Whole-Team Approach

Whole-Team Approach: involving everyone with knowledge and skills neccessary to ensure project success
