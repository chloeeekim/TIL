### 1.1.1 Agile Software Development and the Agile Manifesto

Agile Manifesto contains four statements of values:  
- Individuals and interactions *over* processes and tools
- Working software *over* comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration *over* contract negotiation
- Responding to change *over* following a plan

#### Individuals and Interactions

Agile development: very **people-centered**  
Continuous communication and interaction > Reliance on tools and processes

#### Working Software

Working software > Detailed documentation  
Provides opportunities to get customer's rapid feedback  
Provides **time-to-market advantage**: available early development lifecycle  
Agile development is useful:  
- Rapidly changing business environments
- Problems/solutions are unclear
- Wishes to innovate in new domain

#### Customer Collaboration

Difficult to specify customer's requirements  
Collaborating improves understanding what customer requires  
Regular and close collaboration > Having contracts

#### Responding to Change

Change is **inevitable**  
Lots of factors can have major influences on project and its objectives  
Factors must be accommodated by the development process  
Having Flexibility > Adhering rigidly to a plan

#### Principles

Core Agile Manifesto values are captured in 12 principles:  
- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage
- Deliver working software frequently, at intervals of between a few weeks to a few months, with a preference to the shorter timescale
- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project
- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done
- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation
- Working software is the primary measure of progress
- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility
- Simplicity-the art of maximizing amount of work not done-is essential
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly


### 1.1.2 Whole-Team Approach

Whole-Team Approach: involving everyone with knowledge and skills neccessary to ensure project success  
Includes customer representatives and other business stakeholders  
Should be relatively small: 3-9 people  
Sharing same workspace is *ideal*: for strong communication and interaction  
Supported through daily stand-up meetings: involving all members, communicated work progress and impediments  
Promotes effective and efficient team dynamics  

Main benefits of Agile development include:  
- Enhancing communication and collaboration within the team
- Enabling the various skill sets within the team to be leveraged to the benefit of the project
- Making quality everyone's responsibility

**Whole team is responsible for quality** in Agile projects  
testers, developers and business repressentatives work together in every step of development process  
Testers work closely with others to ensure desired quality levels:  
- Supporting and collaborating with business representatives to create suitable acceptance tests
- Working with developers to agree on testing strategy
- Deciding on test automation approaches
Testers can transfer and extend testing knowledge to others and influence development process  

Whole team is involved in any consultations or meetings about product features  
**Power of Three**: concept of involving testers, developers and business representatives in all feature discussions  


### 1.1.3 Early and Frequent Feedback

Agile projects have short iterations enabling to receive early and continuous feedback throughout development lifecycle  
**Continuous integration** is one way to provide rapid feedback  

Benefits of early and frequent feedback include:
- Avoiding requirements misunderstandings: issues detecting later in progress are more expensive to fix
- Clarifying customer features requests, making them available for customer use early: product better reflects what the customer wants
- Discovering, isolating, and resolving quality problems early
- Providing information to team regarding its productivity and ability to deliver
- Promoting consistent project momentum
